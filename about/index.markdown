About
=====

I'm currently a Rhode Islander, by way of [Boston][bu], [San Francisco][sfsu],
[Los Angeles][mudd], and Manteca, California.  Along the way I've picked up a
[BS in Physics][mudd], master's degrees in [Philosophy][sfsu] and
[Physics][uri], and a PhD in [Physics][bu].  

I’m an assistant professor in the departments of math and science at Johnson
and Wales University, where I get to teach everything. I do some software
development in biophysics and education.

I’ve been married for seven years to an actor and web programmer/project
manager, and together we have a ~3 year old son and a ~3 month old daughter.
