About Me
========

I'm currently a Rhode Islander, by way of [Boston][bu], [San Francisco][sfsu], [Los Angeles][mudd],
and Manteca, California.  Along the way I've picked up a [BS in Physics][mudd],
and master's degrees in [Philosophy][sfsu] and [Physics][uri].  

Somehow I got into software development through work in biophysics in 
graduate school, and I kept taking breaks to teach high school and college
classes as a teaching assistant and grader.

I've been married for five years to an actor and web programmer/project manager,
 and together we have a one year old son who does a lot of eating, crawling, and observing.
