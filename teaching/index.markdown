Guiding Principles
==================
+ Everyone *can* do math and physics.  Everyone *should* do math and physics.
+ There is no such thing as "inactive learning".  Learning requires doing.
+ "Why?" is the most important question anyone can ask.
+ If you haven't been wrong yet today, you aren't working hard enough.
+ Thoughtful pedagogy requires motivation from the research.
