I'm leaving Johnson and Wales at the end of this term, and we're packing up the family and moving to Seattle.  There's a lot that went into this decision, and into all the other decisions entailed by the move, but it all boils down to: we just want our kids to grow up in a place where they will know their grandparents and their cousins, and it's been *so* hard to be away for so long.

So the fact that we are moving was decided a couple of months ago, but the question of what to do about our jobs has only recently been settled.  Sara's worked out an awesome deal to keep her job, and I'm going to be leaving JWU to take a position at an independent high school.
