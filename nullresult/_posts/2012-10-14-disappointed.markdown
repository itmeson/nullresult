Everyone loves the book *Thinking Physics*, by Lewis Carroll Epstein. Everyone recommends it. 

So I finally ordered it a couple weeks ago, thinking that it would be a great
source for questions for my students -- since it's so hard to write good
conceptual questions that root out misconceptions.

It arrived and I was very pleased -- with the physics.  The physics is
excellent, the questions are great, the explanations are clear, the drawings
are entertaining and helpful, and it really does do a good job with those
thorny conceptual details.

And then I read the questions on vectors.

There's a half-page devoted to a drawing of a beauty pageant contestant, in the
swim-wear portion of the competition.  And she's got a triplet of numbers
attached to her, with arrows pointing to the relevant parts.  And the
discussion explains that this person is in fact a vector, because she is
characterized by a set of three numbers.

And I thought: OH MY GOD.  That's probably all I should need to say, but I'll
say more anyway.  OH MY GOD.  Did you seriously just say that a female human
being is characterized by her BUST, WAIST, and HIP measurements?  Without a
trace of irony or self-consciousness?  As though, obviously, this is exactly
the kind of example that our strapping young lads of physics need in order to
really *get* the idea of a vector?

And we wonder why women don't always feel safe in STEM classes and conferences?  Why the gender gap is so persistent? OH MY GOD.

So I'm torn about whether to return the book or just take that page out.  I won't give it to my students.  And when my kids are of an age to talk about vectors, I think I'll come up with my own examples, thank you.

Obviously I should send a note to Mr. Epstein, but I haven't been able to
locate contact info for him.  He's written several other highly-regarded
popular books.  I hope that the people who recommended this one just didn't
look at that page.
