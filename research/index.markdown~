Research 
========
My biophysics work uses coarse-grained protein models to simulate
folding and assembly of amyloid &beta; and &alpha;-synuclein, two
naturally disordered proteins implicated in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively.  Naturally
disordered proteins, unlike normal functional proteins, lack a stable
tertiary structure into which the protein is supposed to fold.
I've been running simulations mimicking different solvent
conditions to explore the free energy landscapes for folding
of these proteins, examining the effect of potential therapeutic
drugs on these free energy landscapes, and finding correlations
between the quasi-stable structures of these proteins and the 
structures of the toxic oligomeric states into which these
proteins sometimes assemble.

 
I work with scientific groups in academia to help
develop simulation, analysis, and workflow tools that make their work
easier, more repeatable, and better documented.

The bottleneck in getting most scientific results is not the speed of
the computations, but the speed of the programmer -- most scientists
have not been trained in computer science, but they are all expected
to use simulation and analysis tools as though they were.  So they end
up spending a huge portion of their time on programming tasks that a
professional software developer could complete in a fraction of the
time.  Worse still, they aren't leveraging their strongest skills to
*do science*.

I use high level programming tools (like Python), which are easily 
documentable and extensible to facilitate automating analysis and 
simulation tasks.  This frees the scientists to do science, and gives
them an audit trail that supports the credibility and repeatability
of their work.
