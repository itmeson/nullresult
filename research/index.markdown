Research 
========
My biophysics work uses coarse-grained protein models to simulate
folding and assembly of amyloid-&beta; and &alpha;-synuclein, two
naturally disordered proteins implicated in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively.  Naturally
disordered proteins, unlike normal functional proteins, lack a stable
tertiary structure into which the protein is supposed to fold.
I've been running simulations mimicking different solvent
conditions to explore the free energy landscapes for folding
of these proteins, examining the effect of potential therapeutic
drugs on these free energy landscapes, and finding correlations
between the quasi-stable structures of these proteins and the 
structures of the toxic oligomeric states into which these
proteins sometimes assemble.

Of course, much of my time is actually spent writing and testing code
to perform various analysis tasks on the millions of protein
conformations produced by these simulations.  In most of these tasks,
computational speed is not critical, but code correctness,
reproducibility, and the ability to track provenance of results
back to raw data **is** critical.  Thus I try to make use of
high level programming languages that are easily documented
to do the analysis and to make record-keeping simpler and more
transparent.
