Research 
========
I'm primarily interested in the development and validation of computational
models in all kinds of systems, and in the development of data
analysis tools that make good use of software engineering
principles to ensure reliability, repeatability, and provenance
tracking.

My biophysics work uses coarse-grained protein models to simulate
folding and assembly of amyloid-&beta; and &alpha;-synuclein, two
naturally disordered proteins implicated in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively.  Naturally
disordered proteins, unlike normal functional proteins, lack a stable
tertiary structure into which the protein is supposed to fold.
I've been running simulations mimicking different solvent
conditions to explore the free energy landscapes for folding
of these proteins, examining the effect of potential therapeutic
drugs on these free energy landscapes, and finding correlations
between the quasi-stable structures of these proteins and the 
structures of the toxic oligomeric states into which these
proteins sometimes assemble.

My current big project is developing a textbook for Discrete Mathematics
that uses the Sage symbolic mathematics system to enable students
to *do* math while they read math.
