Colophon
========

I was looking for a content management system based on simple text
files, where I could control a blog and static content with the same
process (yay emacs!).  I found jekyll through github, and found Mark Reid's site
through the jekyll community.  I have pretty much outright stolen his
design, organization, and templates, because I really like them and
because he released them under a Creative Commons attribution license.
He gets all the credit for the looks here, and I get all the blame for
the content.

That means you are free to use, alter, and disseminate the material
