**Don't Panic.  You can do this.  I can help.**  

Most of my teaching experience has been at the high school level,
where the students have long since been taught abject terror of math
and science, and at the introductory college level, where the
non-major students show even greater fear of the material.  I regard
it as one of my life missions to help such students get through what
many will later regard as the most challenging intellectual experience
of their careers, and on the other side to walk away with (1) a
conceptual understanding of physics as an approach to understanding
the universe, and (2) the confidence to apply that conceptual
understanding to situations beyond the classroom.

In an increasingly specialized world, not everyone can push back the
boundaries of human knowledge in physics, and it is unreasonable to
orient our non-major courses as if they should.  But we can prepare
students to understand where the challenges are and to understand the
process of formulating answers to these challenges.  That will
facilitate a citizenry that is empowered to make decisions with an eye
to the long-term future.  For example, humanity will soon be faced
with difficult decisions about the best way to deal with climate
change.  While economics, politics, and personal philosophy will play
a large role in these decisions, basic understanding of physics will
enable citizens to understand the terms of the debate and contribute
to it meaningfully.

To accomplish this in the classroom I take a learning-centered
approach: nothing is sacred but the ultimate goal of enabling student
learning.  If it works, I will use it.  If it doesn’t work, I’ll get
rid of it.  This requires rigorous attention to assessment, so we can
tell what works; complete openness about what we are doing and why
(surprise guests are always welcome in my classes); and an eye out for
the results of educational research, to help identify and substantiate
new and old best practices.

Currently, I find that what works is to remove myself from the center
of attention as much as possible (in a class in which the teacher is
the only one *doing* anything, the teacher is the only one *learning*
anything); to use realistic projects as frameworks for learning
(students learn best when new knowledge is contextualized and when
they take ownership of the process); to make focused use of
demonstrations as a source of perplexing questions to be answered (to
model the scientific process); guided examples to demonstrate my own
approach and passion for the material; and to keep a careful watch for
common misconceptions that students often take away from new concepts.
